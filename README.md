# Harvard_edX_Python_Labs
# This is a course I started taking in edX.org but unfortunately due to the issues with the exercises not loading correctly in Jupyter Notebook,
# I fell behind and could not complete it during the time-frame, abandoning the entire work. 
# I found that about 22 updates were made that makes the use of Notebooks easier than previous time.
